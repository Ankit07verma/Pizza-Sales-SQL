# Pizza-Sales-SQL
This project focuses on performing end-to-end data analysis using SQL on a pizza sales dataset. The dataset contains detailed information about customer orders, pizza categories, sizes, prices, and quantities. The objective of this project is to explore business insights by writing efficient SQL queries, progressing from basic queries to advanced analytics.

## Basic Analysis
At the initial level, queries were written to answer simple business questions:
* Counted the total number of orders placed.
* Calculated the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
* Identified the highest-priced pizza on the menu.
* Determined the most commonly ordered pizza size.
* Retrieved the Top 5 most popular pizza types based on quantity.

These queries provide a strong foundation in filtering, aggregation, and sorting.

## Intermediate Analysis
This stage focuses on combining tables and analyzing patterns in sales:
*Joined datasets to calculate the total quantity of pizzas ordered per category.
*Explored time-based order distribution by hour of the day.
*Examined the category-wise breakdown of pizzas ordered.
*Grouped data by date to find the average number of pizzas sold per day.
*Identified the Top 3 pizzas by revenue contribution.

Here, joins, grouping, and date functions play a critical role in business insights.

## Advanced Analysis
In the final stage, advanced analytical queries were performed:
*Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
*Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
*Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.
